-- This function takes a statement and calculates the liveIn set for it. For that, it takes a VariableSet
-- which holds the liveIn of its successors, which would correspond to the liveOut of the statement.
-- Also, it takes a vector of m VariableSet values, which at the end of the entire liveness analysis
-- should hold the liveOut of each of the m assignments in the original program. As a side effect of the
-- liveIn calculation of an assignment, the function updates the corresponding index in the vector. That
-- result will then be used in one of the rules of the typing system.

-- Uses an iterative method to calculate the liveIn set of a WHILE statement.
-- The way this works is that it starts by taking the liveIn set of the statement following the 
-- WHILE block (nextLiveIn) and joins it with the GEN set of the loop condition. That union will 
-- be used as the liveIn passed to the liveness analysis of the loop's body. Said analysis returns 
-- the liveIn set for the body. Then, if that result is a subset of the liveIn set passed as an 
-- argument, then we have finished iterating and have a final result. Otherwise, we take the union 
-- between those two sets and use that as the nextLiveIn for a new iteration of the function.
-- This process is guaranteed to finish because between iterations nextLiveIn can only grow in size
-- and the total number of possible variables is set for the program so there is an upper bound to
-- the resulting set size. 
-- TODO(major): See how to prove that this function terminates.
